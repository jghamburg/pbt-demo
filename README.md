# Property Based Testing Evaluation

In the past I did a lot of unit and integration testing in Java. It was easy to reason about the
imperative process of services. What I was missing out was the possibility to reason about rules or
properties that my software shoud follow to conform to the business requirements.

After reading a lot about functional programming I stumbled over the term "Property Based Testing"
aka PBT.

The basic idea:

1. Specify rules that the software under test should follow.
2. And verify this behavior with generated tests like in the 100 or 1.000 instead of at most ten
   examples like I used to do in the past.

As I first ask about experiences on pbt in my company I found out that it is still not widely known
in the Java community.

And on the other hand I heard things like:

* "I already use specification by example. So why jet another framefork to learn?"
* "What is the benefit of this? - I already have a very high test coverage."

So basically I will try to motivate why I think it is worth it to invest into the ideas and the
learning of PBT.

But why yet another testing framework?

For all the examples I use jqwik provided by Johannes Link, how is well known in the java testing
community.
